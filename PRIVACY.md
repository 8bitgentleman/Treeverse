Treeverse runs entirely in your browser. No data is collected or tracked by Treeverse directly when you use or install it. Browser extension installs may be tracked by Google and Mozilla, and the data requests made to Twitter may be tracked by Twitter.

When you create a sharable link, the data is sent to a server so that it can be made available to other users. Access to the shared link server may be tracked to prevent abuse.

Additionally, when Treeverse runs it loads a font hosted by Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/). Google may track this download.
